This summer, I've been watching these [lectures on Javascript] by Douglas Crockford. Do yourself a favor, and check them out. Seriously. I learned a lot about the history and design of computers and programming languages, how the fight or flight response influences computer programming, and how Javascript fits in with all of this.


[Crockford][] is the author of [Javascript: The Good Parts][], a book I've heard a lot of good things about, but haven't read yet.

It's on my list.
