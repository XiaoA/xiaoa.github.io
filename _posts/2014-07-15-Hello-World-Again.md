After four years without a blog, I'm back at it again, with a new blog and a new purpose.

I've created a few blogs and websites in the past. My longest-running blog was "The Wayfarer Blog," a self-hosted WordPress blog that detailed my daily experiences as an expat in Japan. I shared my experiences living abroad, as I struggled to improve my Japanese and Chinese; as time went on, my passion for photography and technology played an increasingly important part, as well. I've archived it here: [http://thewayfarerblog.wordpress.com/](http://thewayfarerblog.wordpress.com/).

This blog will explore my interest in web development. Although I am not a full-time developer (yet!), I have been building websites for myself and others, since 1995 or 1996. It's something I've been passionate about for a long time, and I want to take this to next level. I have a lot to learn, and I'm really excited to share it here!
