I'd glanced at [Ruby Monk][monk] before, but I'd never actually gone through any of the lessons before today. It's really fun and useful.

The genius of the site is in the interactive feedback you get from the "Master." As you progress though the lessons, you can type in code in the embedded command line, and run it. With each exercise, you're greeted with fun feedback, which runs the gambit of references to a book of Zen Koans, The Matrix, and more than a few Mr. Miyagi quotes.

<!-- more -->

Because the feedback amused me, and I wanted to get just one more "compliment" from the Master, I was motivated to answer just one more question, even though I was really tired.

Some of my favorite sayings included:

* "You have made your brothers proud."
* "Would you like to learn Kung Fu?
* What goes on inside your head I do not always understand. But what goes on in your heart will never let us down."

Of course, I also got some wrong answers, but I'd rather not relive the trauma of letting the Master (and my brothers...?) down.

Learning should always be this fun.
