If you haven't checked out [meetup.com](http://meetup.com), you could be missing out on a great way to network and meet other people who share your interests. I've been going to local Ruby and Rails meetups since last year, and I've always enjoyed meeting people, and learning new things. The other day, one of the leaders of the KCRuby group asked me to give a demo of Emacs. As it turns out, I didn't have time to give a talk, but had already made an outline, in [org-mode](http://orgmode.org), so I shared it with them afterwards. In case it's useful to anyone else, here it is. Even if you don't use Emacs, there might be something useful for you. For example, I also referenced useful plugins for Vim and Sublime Text.

The plan was to present it, in outline form, from within Emacs. Here's a more browser-friendly version:
