        <p>Laura Frank at Codeship:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One important thing to remember is that Docker != containers, and in fact there are other ways to use containers than with Docker. But since Docker makes it so easy, it’s almost a no-brainer to use their tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her post includes links to the video, slides, and code. It’s well worth a read.</p>

        <p>Derek Prior, outlining the benefits of <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/scenic">Scenic</a>, Thoughtbot’s open-source database view implementation for Rails:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all of that in place, our N+1 query is gone and we’ve significantly decreased garbage collection pressure. A benchmark of both methods with production data shows that the previously existing Ruby implementation is 85 times slower than our new implementation that makes use of the view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This looks like a great way to improve query performance, by moving views to the database level. I’m definitely going to look at using this for my next Rails project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s so much easier to write expressive code when you know more methods. I hope that this collection of curiosities helped expand your Ruby vocabulary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more Ruby you learn, the more expressive and elegant your code becomes. There are always different (and arguably better) ways to solve problems. There’s so much I still have to learn. For example, I wasn’t very familiar with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap method</a>.</p>

<p>I think many people prefer not to write plain html because there comes a point where you can’t really improve it, so it feels like it’s getting in the way of what you’re trying to accomplish. But using a language like Ruby is a creative endeavor, and it rewards practice and experimentation. Repetitive tasks should be automated, to allow more time for complex or creative pursuits.</p>

        <p>Mike Buss has a great tip on <a href="http://mikebuss.com/2015/01/27/linklogs-with-jekyll/">how to easily set up ‘linklog’ functionality</a> in a Jekyll blog. That, along with documentation from <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/linklog/">Octopress</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/">Jekyll</a>, helped me though the process.</p>

<p>I often encounter useful links and tips, that don’t necessarily require a lot of elaboration. I’ll still write longer blog posts, but this will allow me to curate more information for others, as well as for my own reference. Links that go to external sites will have a different color (currently light gray), and they’ll have a right arrow to the right of the title. Also, I’ve added a permalink to every article (the ‘infinity’ sign to the right of the date on the Blog index page).</p>

        <p>I have been very busy over the past few months, working on projects, networking, and getting settled in Seattle again. I have also been lending my talents as a Rails developer to a local startup, which is going to launch soon. Not only have I learned a lot, but it feels good to work on a project that could really help people. I will have more information on that in the near future.</p>

<p>Seattle has a very active tech community, and I dived in as soon as I got here. In addition to the many ongoing Ruby, JS, and technical meetups I attend several times a week, I attended a few very useful presentations…</p>

        <p>Two nights ago (Tuesday, October 20, 2015), I attended the Seattle HackerNest Tech Social. Because I had some free time, I decided to volunteer, and I had a blast! I found out about it through <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>, which I’ve <a href="http://andrewbuckingham.net/blog/2015/07/17/kcruby-emacs-demo/">mentioned before</a>. Apparently, there had been a local group before, but they’d stopped meeting for a while, so this was a relaunch.</p>

        <p>I left Seattle, for Japan, on September 4, 2003. Almost 12 years year, my wife and I returned, back in August. A lot has changed here in those years, but it’s been a pretty comfortable process. Not long after I got here, I jumped into a project, helping an old friend, with a legacy web application that was part .NET (.aspx), part PHP 5, and part WordPress. It was quite a challenge. She’d worked with several developers, and the project had stalled out. I helped her get the project back on track, fixed some issues, documented all of the files and functions in the code, and helped her interview and hire a competent development team.</p>

        <p>If you haven’t checked out <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>, you could be missing out on a great way to network and meet other people who share your interests. I’ve been going to local Ruby and Rails meetups since last year, and I’ve always enjoyed meeting people, and learning new things. The other day, one of the leaders of the KCRuby group asked me to give a demo of Emacs. As it turns out, I didn’t have time to give a talk, but had already made an outline, in <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a>, so I shared it with them afterwards. In case it’s useful to anyone else, here it is. Even if you don’t use Emacs, there might be something useful for you. For example, I also referenced useful plugins for Vim and Sublime Text.</p>

        <p>In my current project for the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!production-apps">final Rails course</a> at <a href="gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a>, I’m creating ‘MyFlix,’ a clone of Netflix, built with Ruby, instead of Java. I just added functionality to search for a video by title, but it was case-sensitive, so a search for <code>monk</code> returned an empty array, but a search for <code>Monk</code> returned the proper result. I wasn’t satisfied with that, so I decided to implement case-insensitive searches. Fortunately, it’s really easy in Postgresql. Here’s how I did it…</p>
