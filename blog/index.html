        <span class="post-date">Oct 22, 2015</span>
        <p>Two nights ago (Tuesday, October 20, 2015), I attended the Seattle HackerNest Tech Social. Because I had some free time, I decided to volunteer, and I had a blast! I found out about it through <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>, which I’ve <a href="http://andrewbuckingham.net/blog/2015/07/17/kcruby-emacs-demo/">mentioned before</a>. Apparently, there had been a local group before, but they’d stopped meeting for a while, so this was a relaunch.</p>

        <p>I left Seattle, for Japan, on September 4, 2003. Almost 12 years year, my wife and I returned, back in August. A lot has changed here in those years, but it’s been a pretty comfortable process. Not long after I got here, I jumped into a project, helping an old friend, with a legacy web application that was part .NET (.aspx), part PHP 5, and part WordPress. It was quite a challenge. She’d worked with several developers, and the project had stalled out. I helped her get the project back on track, fixed some issues, documented all of the files and functions in the code, and helped her interview and hire a competent development team.</p>

        <p>If you haven’t checked out <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>, you could be missing out on a great way to network and meet other people who share your interests. I’ve been going to local Ruby and Rails meetups since last year, and I’ve always enjoyed meeting people, and learning new things. The other day, one of the leaders of the KCRuby group asked me to give a demo of Emacs. As it turns out, I didn’t have time to give a talk, but had already made an outline, in <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a>, so I shared it with them afterwards. In case it’s useful to anyone else, here it is. Even if you don’t use Emacs, there might be something useful for you. For example, I also referenced useful plugins for Vim and Sublime Text.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jul 13, 2015</span>
        <p>In my current project for the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!production-apps">final Rails course</a> at <a href="gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf Academy</a>, I’m creating ‘MyFlix,’ a clone of Netflix, built with Ruby, instead of Java. I just added functionality to search for a video by title, but it was case-sensitive, so a search for <code>monk</code> returned an empty array, but a search for <code>Monk</code> returned the proper result. I wasn’t satisfied with that, so I decided to implement case-insensitive searches. Fortunately, it’s really easy in Postgresql. Here’s how I did it…</p>

        <p>The second course at <a href="http://gotealeaf.com">Tealeaf</a> delved into Ruby on Rails development, from the ground up. Most tutorials and guides that I’ve seen include either scaffolding, or at least using generators, as shortcuts for building apps, (not to mention, lots of gems). There’s nothing wrong with using shortcuts, but we built <em>everything</em> ourselves, because it helps us learn how Rails works. The only generators we used were for migrations, but we still wrote the migation files.</p>

        <p>Last month, my failing hard drive took up a lot of my attention, but I still managed to keep working, and I made progress on my Rails project, as well. I’ve written a few drafts over the last few weeks, but I honestly think they can can be combined into one simple post. (I’m pretty anxious to talk about what I’m doing now, rather than my issues from last month!) Still, there are a few things I learned, and a couple tips that might be useful for others, so I’ll condense it down to one post.</p>

        <p>The last few weeks have been quite interesting. I had a lot of computer problems, which culminated in my replacing a failing hard drive. It was much easier than I thought. I’ll discuss that in another post, but for now, I’d like to share my answers to the third quiz of the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!rails">Tealeaf Academy Course 2</a>.</p>

<p>As always, I answered the quiz questions with my course notes in <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a>, and converted them into a Github gist. Here are my answers…</p>

        <p>I’ve enabled <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments on this site. In past blogs, I used comments, but many of the arguments against them make sense to me. In some cases, comments invite a lot of negativity and spam, and require too much administration. But there are also many examples where comments have helped build a strong sense of community and added value to a blog. I’d like to give it a shot, because I’d love to hear from my readers.</p>

<p>Setting up comments for my Jekyll blog was easy.</p>

        <p>I’ve completed the first lesson of <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!rails">Course 2</a>. In the pre-course, we followed the classic Ruby on Rails <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">‘Build a Blog’</a> tutorial, which was great, because I did that back in July, but this time, I could open the files, and understand the Ruby syntax. The tutorial uses Rails generators, which <em>auto-magically</em> build the pages and tables for you. When you run the code, and the files are set up in seconds, it looks impressive, but it isn’t clear to beginners what is happening. By the end of this course, I’ll be able to build a Rails project from scratch, without any gimmicks or shortcuts. </p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time going over the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html">Rails guides</a>, the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org">Rails API documentation</a>, and reading blogs and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Rails">Stack Overflow</a> to deepen my understanding. I read a lot of technical writing and documentation at work, and I’ve learned that the most important thing is to go from an <em>extensive</em> understanding to an <em>intensive</em> understanding. In other words, the first time you go through the documentation, you’re going to be bombarded with information, much of which will not be relevant of perhaps even very easy to digest. But you should get an overall feel of the features and limitations of the product or system. Most imporantly, you should make sure that you can refer to it again, so that when you need that information, you can find it. Unless you have a photographic memory, you’re not going to memorize it all in one reading, or even several.</p>

        <p>Step up and place your bets! I’ve created a simple Blackjack game here: <a href="https://salty-crag-8411.herokuapp.com/">https://salty-crag-8411.herokuapp.com/</a>. I hope you’ll give it a try! I built it with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> and deployed it to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>Like Rails, Sinatra is a Domain-Specific Language, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>, based on Ruby. Sinatra uses a simple syntax for specifying routes with Ruby blocks, which are outlined on Sinatra’s <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html">Getting Started</a> page.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/XiaoA/sinatra_blackjack_webapp">Sinatra Blackjack game</a>, these routes help control the flow of the Blackjack game, as the player competes with the dealer for the highest Blackjack score (21). Just like Rails, it uses the <a href="mvc">MVC</a> pattern to render or redirect the appropriate page. Sinatra is a pure joy to work with; simple but powerful! Here’s how I used it to build a simple Blackjack game.</p>
